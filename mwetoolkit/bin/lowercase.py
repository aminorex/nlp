   This script homogenises the case of a corpus. Two possible lowercasing 
   algorithms are proposed: simple and complex. The former lowercases 
   everything, regardless of acronyms, proper names, dates, etc. The latter 
   keeps the case of words that do not present a preferred form, i.e. words that 
   might occur uppercased even if they are not at the beginning of a sentence. 
   Some fuzzy thresholds are hardcoded and were fixed based on empirical 
   observation of the Genia corpus. Since you are supposed to perform 
   lowercasing before any linguistic processing, this script operates on surface 
   forms. Any lemma information will be ignored during lowercasing, unless you
   use -l option.

usage_string = """Usage: 
    
python {program} OPTIONS <corpus>

The <corpus> input file must be in one of the filetype
formats accepted by the `--from` switch.


OPTIONS may be:

--from <input-filetype-ext>
    Force conversion from given filetype extension.
    (By default, file type is automatically detected):
    {descriptions.input[corpus]}

--to <output-filetype-ext>
    Convert input to given filetype extension.
    (By default, keeps input in original format):
    {descriptions.output[corpus]}

-a OR --algorithm
    The name of the lowercasing algorithm used to convert from upper to 
    lowercase characters. Supported algorithms are:
    * "simple" (default): lowercases everything, regardless of acronyms, proper 
      names, dates, etc.
    * "complex": keeps the case of words that do not present a preferred form, 
      i.e. words that might occur uppercased even if they are not at the beginning 
      of a sentence. Some fuzzy thresholds are hardcoded and were fixed based on
      empirical observation of the Genia corpus.
    * "aggressive": lowercases all words that do not occur more than 90% of the
      time in upper/mixed case. For instance, if a word never appears in lowercase,
      it will be kept. Words that occur in various cases will be lowercased.

-l OR --lemmas
    Lowercase lemmas instead of surface forms. Might be useful when dealing with
    corpora which were accidentally parsed before lowercasing, and the parser
    doesn't lowercase lemmas (as it is the case in RASP 2, for instance)

-x OR --text
    DEPRECATED: Use --from=PlainCorpus instead.

-m OR --moses
    DEPRECATED: Use --from=Moses instead.

{common_options}

IMPORTANT: you are supposed to perform lowercasing before any linguistic
processing. Therefore, this algorithm operates on surface forms by default. 
Except if you specify the -l option, lemmas will be ignored during 
lowercasing.
